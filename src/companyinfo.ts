Many women experience low blood levels (anemia). This can happen due to poor diet,
heavy periods, pregnancy, or other health conditions.

What to do:
Eat iron-rich foods such as spinach, lentils, meat, and beans.
Include Vitamin C foods (oranges, lemon, guava) to help your body absorb iron.
Try to rest properly and stay hydrated.
If symptoms continue, consult a healthcare professional.

Important Tests:
Complete Blood Count (CBC)
Iron Levels (Ferritin, Serum Iron, TIBC)

You can also visit the lab available in the Poocho app for tests.

Questions & Answers About Anemia
--------------------------------------

1. What is anemia?
Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells or hemoglobin, causing tiredness and weakness.

2. What are the symptoms of anemia?
Tiredness
Pale skin
Dizziness
Shortness of breath
Fast heartbeat

3. What causes anemia in women?
Answer: One of the main causes of anemia in women is heavy menstrual bleeding, which can lead to a significant loss of iron in the body. Pregnancy is another common reason because the body needs extra iron to support both the mother and the developing baby. A low-iron diet can also contribute to anemia, especially when women do not eat enough iron-rich foods. In addition, vitamin deficiencies—such as a lack of vitamin B12 or folic acid—can reduce the body’s ability to produce healthy blood cells, leading to anemia.

How anemia is detected:
Anemia is usually detected through blood tests that measure different components of your blood. The most common test is the Complete Blood Count (CBC), which checks your hemoglobin and red blood cell levels. Additional tests like Ferritin, Serum Iron, and Vitamin B12 or Folate levels help doctors understand whether the anemia is caused by low iron or vitamin deficiencies. These tests give a complete picture of your body’s blood health.

How anemia can be improved:
Anemia can often be improved by making healthy changes to your diet and lifestyle. Eating iron-rich foods such as spinach, meat, lentils, and beans helps raise hemoglobin levels. Including Vitamin C in your meals—like oranges, lemon, or guava—helps your body absorb iron more effectively. Supplements may also help, but they should only be taken if a doctor recommends them, based on your specific blood test results.

6. When should someone see a doctor?
If symptoms continue or worsen over time.
